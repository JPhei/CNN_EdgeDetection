# Cellular Nonlinear Network
A software implementation of the cellular nonlinear network (CNN) developed by Leon Chua.  

## Background
- [Leon Chua's HP Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1rLjjjjbbE&index=6&list=PLtS6YX0YOX4eAQ6IrOZSta3xjRXzpcXyi) - I highly recommend this set of lectures. He goes over biology, complexity, chaos, and a very important emerging technology for ML, memristors.
